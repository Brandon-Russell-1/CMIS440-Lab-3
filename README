Program Name: CMIS440 Lab 3 JavaDB Address Book Program
@author Brandon R Russell
@Course CMIS440
Date: Dec 15,2010
IDE: NetBeans 6.9.1
OS: Windows 7
Java: JDK 1.6.0_22
Files: AddressBookDisplay.java, PersonQueries.java, Person.java,
        BooksDisplay.java, BooksQuery.java, Book.java

Program Requirements:
Minimum Assignment Requirements:
 
1)Install and configure the Java DB per section 28.10 of the text. 
2)If you use the text book examples as your starting point, you will 
demonstrate you understand the code by a) commenting the code to meet 
the course standards and b) ensuring the course naming conventions 
are followed. 
3)Implement the additions stated in Exercise 28.6 of the text. 
4)Implement the additions stated in Exercise 28.7 of the text. 
5)Add a JTextArea to the main UI form for the display of the internal
'debugging' statements. 
6)Create a class called TextAreaLogger that takes a JTextArea in its 
contructor and provides one or more log methods. Possible log methods 
might be: 

log(String msg) - log the given message to the provided JTextArea 
log(String msg, int value) - log the given message and value to the 
provided JTextArea in a format: message = value 
7)Add a getLastError method to the PersonQueries class. The backing variable 
should be cleared (set to null) at the beginning of each method in the 
class and will contain any error messages that occurred in the method, i.e.,
replace the current sqlException.printStackTrace() to use this last error 
variable. This implies that after every method call on a PersonQueries 
instance you should check to see if the returned value of getLastError()
is null, meaning the operation was successful, or not null meaning the 
operation failed. All failures should be written to the 'debugging'
JTextArea. 
8)Remove all System.exit calls in the PersonQueries class and use the last
error variable approach outlined above. 
9)Add strategically placed logging statements in your UI code only. 

Assignment Optional Implementations:

1)Add support for the Books database in a similar manner as the Address
database by creating a Book class, BooksQuery class and BoosDisplay form
class.

Things you what me to know before I grade your work: I used the NetBeans
Graphic designer to create the GUI portion of this program.
